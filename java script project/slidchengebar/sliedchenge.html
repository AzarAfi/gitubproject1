                    The ancient Egyptians used wooden doors in their tombs and temples. Early doors were simple wooden slabs that were likely imported due to the scarcity of wood in Egypt. They were used for security and decoration and were often painted or carved with hieroglyphics and scenes from daily life.In Mesopotamia, wooden doors were also used, particularly for temples and significant buildings. These doors were often massive and symbolized the importance of the building they protected.
